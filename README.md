## ðŸ‘¥ Team Project

This project was developed as a team effort.  
**My contributions:**  
- Developed the backend logic for personalized nutrition recommendations using BMI/TDEE formulas and SciPy linear programming.
- Designed and integrated the interactive charts and graphs (Recharts) for daily and weekly nutrient tracking.
- Contributed to API endpoints and data processing with Pandas and Flask.

âœ… This clarifies what I owned while collaborating with teammates on other modules (UI, blog, deployment, etc.).
