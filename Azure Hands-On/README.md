Azure Hands-On Deployment (Whizlabs Sandbox)

This folder contains screenshots and notes related to my hands-on practice of deploying a web application on Azure using the Whizlabs Azure sandbox.
üîß Project Tech Stack
- Backend: Python Flask
- Frontend: React.js
- Database: (Not used in sandbox, planned for future)
- Additional tools: Node.js (for frontend build), GitHub

üåê Attempted Deployment Steps
1. Created an App Service in Azure
2. Tried to connect using Kudu and Local Git
3. Faced limitations due to Premium tier requirement
4. Took alternate route to document the deployment attempt

‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations Faced
- Whizlabs sandbox restricts use of **Premium App Service Plans**
- Could not enable Kudu or FTPS
- Local Git option not available
- Editor replaced by "Recommended Services"

‚úÖ Outcome
Although I could not fully deploy the backend due to sandbox limitations, I gained hands-on experience with:
- App Service creation
- Azure Portal navigation
- Deployment process
- Real-world deployment blockers

üì∏ Screenshots Included
- App Service Setup
- Error Screens
- Portal Settings
